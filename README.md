# Professional README.md Generator

## Description
This in terminal application can be used to make a skeleton or fleshed out professional README by asking you to provide key information and plugging it into some preset markdown. Then, it gets written to a file and voila! Your professional README is ready to be used or revised how you like!

## Motivation
I wanted an easy way to create a quality README.md without having to try and remember the components or look it up online. It's a great tool for convenience sake. It also makes sure you don't forget any parts!

## Installation
Fork and/or clone the codebase from github and open in your IDE. You'll want to run the command `npm install` in the terminal from the codes root directory. After that, the codeis ready to be executed.

## Usage
Open your terminal to the code's root directory. Run `node index.js` and you will be asked a series of input questions. Answer to the best of your ability, it could always be updated later. After all questions have been answered, a README directory will be made with your new professional README.md inside! 

As a side note, the code can only be executed one time. If you want to remake the README, you have to delete the README.md and the README directory.
